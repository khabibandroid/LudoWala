Canvas Particle - Shuriken Render
------------------------

Requires Unity 2017.3 or higher

- Works on any kind of UI Canvas
- Works with Atlas multi-texture


How To

- Attach a ShurikenCanvasRenderer component into the same object as the Unity's Shuriken Particle;
- Set any parent of these object to be a UI Canvas object;
- Adjust the Size Multiplier attribute of the ShurikenCanvasRenderer to adjust the render size in the canvas
- Repeat the process to all nodes that have a Shuriken Particle System.

- Attention: Observe the 3D rotation of the main particle object after setting it as child of a Canvas object. 
Sometimes Unity's change the object rotation to maintain world orientation. The canvas render will work only with X and Y rotations to 0.
- Please note that some Materials used on standard particles aren't compatible with Canvas Renderer, so some tweaks on particle materiasl might be necessary.
